A **chatbot** is an artificial intelligence software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone, etc. These chatbots can be used in various industries for different purposes.

Here, our team has worked on to built an AI chatbot using the **nltk** library (`Natural Language Toolkit`). The chat bot is capable of using the data provided in the `data.txt` file to reply with caliberated informations related to **COVID-19**.
